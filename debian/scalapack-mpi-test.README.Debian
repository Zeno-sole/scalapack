Test executables for scalapack are provided in /usr/lib/<arch>/scalapack, 
for both openmpi and mpich versions.

Test executables for PBLAS and BLACS are provided in the PBLAS and 
BLACS subdirectories.

These tests are most conveniently launched by running cmake's ctest in the 
directory containing the executables (and CTestTestfile.cmake). Copy the 
test directories to a writable location to allow temporary files and 
subdirs to be created by ctest.
